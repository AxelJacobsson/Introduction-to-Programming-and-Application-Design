# Setting up Your Machine [(Download)](https://github.com/martensievers/Resource-Files/raw/master/Lesson%201%20-%20Setting%20up%20Your%20Machine.pdf)

## Downloads & Installation:

Start by downloading and installing Visual Studio Code (Text Editor) and Node.js (Runtime). **NOTE:** If you are on a mac, you need to install Xcode as well, to be able to run Node.js.

**Visual Studio Code:** https://code.visualstudio.com

**Node.js:** https://nodejs.org/en

**[Mac Only] Xcode:** https://itunes.apple.com/dk/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12




## Debugging

Open the Terminal on you computer and run `node -v` in the console to check if Node.js was successfully installed. If you see `v10.15.1` or any other version of Node.js and no error message, everything should be fine!




## Hello JavaScript!

After installing everything, create a new file called `script.js` and write the following code on line 0.

      console.log("Hello, World!")

Next, open the Terminal and navigate to the file location. Run `node script.js` and wait for the magic!
