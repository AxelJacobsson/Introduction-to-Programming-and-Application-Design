# Git & JavaScript Basics -  [![alt text](https://icon-icons.com/icons2/936/PNG/32/download-to-storage-drive_icon-icons.com_73590.png "Download Lesson 1: Setting up Your Machine")](https://github.com/martensievers/Resource-Files/raw/master/Lesson%201%20-%20Setting%20up%20Your%20Machine.pdf)

## Downloads & Installation:

Start by downloading and installing Git (Version Control Management) and create an account on Github.com</br>
**NOTE:** If you are on a mac and you have installed Xcode version 4 or higher, git is already installed. You can check this by typing `git --version` in the terminal.

**Git:** https://git-scm.com

**GitHub:** https://github.com


## Debugging

Open the Terminal on you computer and run `git --version` in the console to check if Git was successfully installed. If you see `git version 2.17.2` or any other version of Git and no error message, everything should be fine!


## Git Fundamentals!

Before you start reading any of the below, please make sure to read this [Git Tutorial for Beginners: Introduction to Version Control](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/git-tutorial-for-beginners-version-control/)

Now that you have read the article and know what Git is all about, here are the fundamental commands that you can use in the Terminal:

Git Command | Action
--- | :---:
***git status*** | Check git status in current directory
***git init*** | Initialise a new repository in current directory
***git add filename*** | Add a new file to your git stash
***git commit -m "message text"*** | Commit any changes in your stash to your working index
***git push -u origin master*** | Push changes to the master branch on Github
***git pull*** | Pull new changes from the master branch


## Github Exercise

Start by creating a new directory on your machine. Next you will create a new repository on Github and follow the instructions to connect your local directory with your remote repository. See example:


Find you initial  `script.js` file with your 'Hello, World' program and copy it into the new directory on your local machine. Now, add the file to git, commit it as a new change to the stash (remember to specify a commit message) and push the changes to your Github account.

### Congratulations, you successfully committed your first code to Github. You have now entered the world of professional development!
